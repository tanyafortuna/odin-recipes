  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>If you like spinach, you're probably already sold on this recipe. And if you don't...well, this recipe is mostly cheese, dairy, and onions. What could be wrong with that?</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>2 Tbs butter</li>
    <li>2 C chopped yellow onions (1 large)</li>
    <li>2 Tbs flour</li>
    <li>1/8 tsp grated nutmeg</li>
    <li>1/2 C heavy cream</li>
    <li>1 C milk</li>
    <li>24 oz frozen chopped spinach, defrosted</li>
    <li>1/2 C freshly grated Parmesan cheese (minimum, measure with your heart)</li>
    <li>1/2 Tbs kosher salt</li>
    <li>1/4 tsp freshly ground black pepper</li>
    <li>1/4 C grated Gruyere cheese (or more, c'mon now)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.</li>
    <li>Melt the butter in a large, heavy-bottomed saute pan over medium heat. Add the onions and saute until translucent, about 15 minutes.</li>
    <li>Add the flour and nutmeg and cook, stirring, for 2 more minutes. </li>
    <li>Add the cream and milk and cook until thickened.</li>
    <li>Squeeze as much liquid as possible from the spinach and add the spinach to the sauce.</li>
    <li>Add half of the Parmesan cheese and mix well. Season, to taste, with salt and pepper.</li>
    <li>Transfer the spinach to a baking dish and sprinkle the remaining Parmesan and the Gruyere on top. Bake for 20 minutes until hot and bubbly. Serve hot.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Notes</h2>
  <p>You can prep this dish the day before and refrigerate until you're ready to bake. If you do, increase the bake time by about 5 minutes.</p>
