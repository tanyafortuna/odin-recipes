  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    This is a killer green bean casserole recipe - it has converted folks who
    previously disliked green beans! One of those people is my husband, who made
    this with me for our first date, skeptically, and fell in love with the dish
    (and me, not skeptically).</p>
  
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>2 Tbs kosher salt</li>
    <li>1 lb fresh green beans, rinsed, trimmed, and halved</li>
    <li>2 Tbs unsalted butter</li>
    <li>12 oz mushrooms, trimmed and cut into 1/2" pieces</li>
    <li>1 tsp salt</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp black pepper</li>
    <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp nutmeg</li>
    <li>2 Tbs all-purose flour</li>
    <li>1 C chicken broth</li>
    <li>1 C half-and-half</li>
    <li>French's Crispy Fried Onions (measure with your heart; I use 1-2 large cans)
    </li>
  </ul>

  
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 475 degrees F.</li>
    <li>Bring a gallon of water and 2 tablespoons of salt to a boil in a large pot. Add the beans and blanch for 5 minutes. Drain in a colander and immediately plunge the beans into a large bowl of ice water to stop the cooking. Drain and set aside.</li>
    <li>Melt the butter in a 12-inch cast iron skillet set over medium-high heat. Add the mushrooms, 1 teaspoon salt and pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until the mushrooms begin to give up some of their liquid, approximately 4 to 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Add the garlic and nutmeg and continue to cook for another 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
    <li>Sprinkle the flour over the mixture and stir to combine. Cook for 1 minute.</li>
    <li>Add the broth and simmer for 1 minute.</li>
    <li>Decrease the heat to medium-low and add the half-and-half. Cook until the mixture thickens, stirring occasionally, approximately 6 to 8 minutes.</li>
    <li>Remove from the heat and stir in 1/4 of the onions and all of the green beans. Top with the remaining onions.</li>
    <li>Place into the oven and bake until bubbly, approximately 15 minutes. Remove and serve immediately.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Notes</h2>
  <p>You can prep this dish the day before and refrigerate until you're ready to bake. If you do, wait to top the casserole with the onions until you're ready to bake, and increase the bake time by about 5 minutes.</p>
