# odin-recipes

This is the first project in The Odin Project. It is a basic recipe website. 

First, I wrote the HTML.
Later in The Odin Project, I added some basic CSS.
In the future, I wonder if The Odin Project will have me come back again to add Javascript? 

This site is deployed on GitHub Pages [here](https://tanyafortuna.github.io/odin-recipes/).
